widgets
=======

This repository is intended to hold reference examples of iFrame annotation implementations that extend the standard functionality of the HapYak platform.

To use these examples you must copy them and paste them into an iFrame widget annotation on your video.

NOTE: Some examples require a specific HapYak license. Please carefully review the implementation to make sure it will work for you.



Examples:

*Loop-back widget*
This widget will replay a segment of the video until a certain variable is set. If a user attempts to scrub into the video beyond the segment, the widget will seek back to the beginning of the segment. It allows you to create custom "Gate" logic for branching, or information gathering.
